A default and an exercise fileClass are provided, with configuration files for exercise routes and file types. The conf files can be edited manually or via the Metadata Menu modal. A number of CSS files are included in the hidden `obsidian/snippets` directory.\n\n# Images\nThe layout expects images of 100 pixels wide, and so the field should look like `![[Name of Image.png|100]]`.\n","x":-1500,"y":-600,"width":930,"height":520},
