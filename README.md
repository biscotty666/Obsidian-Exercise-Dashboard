![ExcCanvas](https://github.com/biscotty666/Obsidian-Exercise-Dashboard/assets/107413839/dcda2ef5-f235-49cb-b165-2b3edfe88d54)


## Description

This vault is configured to log walking and biking activities. It is based around the [Freeing Your Thinking](https://biscotty.online/blogs/freeing-your-thinking-part-1) workflow. 

## Usage

Log entries can be created with `ctrl-U`, then adding the exercise file class and the associated fields via the context (right-click) menu, and filling out, at a minimum, activity type, activity date, distance and duration via the Metadata Menu modal. **Each log (note) must have a type of "log". **

# Contents

In addition to the canvas, the vault includes templates for unique notes and exercise logs (notes). A default and an exercise fileClass are provided, with configuration files for exercise routes and file types. The conf files can be edited manually or via the Metadata Menu modal. A number of CSS files are included in the hidden `obsidian/snippets` directory.

# Images

The layout expects images of 100 pixels wide, and so the field should look like `![[Name of Image.png|100]]`
